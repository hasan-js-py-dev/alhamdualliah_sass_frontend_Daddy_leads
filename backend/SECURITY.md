# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Daddy Leads authentication system.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Token Storage Security
- **Hashed Session Tokens**: All JWT tokens are hashed using HMAC-SHA256 before being stored in MongoDB
- **Database Leak Protection**: Even if the database is compromised, stored tokens cannot be used directly
- **Secret-based Hashing**: Uses SESSION_SECRET environment variable for token hashing

### 2. Authentication Flow Security
- **Protected Logout Route**: Logout endpoint now requires valid JWT authentication
- **User-bound Session Deletion**: Sessions can only be deleted by the authenticated user
- **Token Validation**: All protected routes validate both JWT and session existence

### 3. Response Data Minimization
- **Reduced User Data**: API responses only include essential user information
- **No Credit Exposure**: User credit balances removed from auth responses
- **Dedicated Endpoints**: Sensitive data should be accessed through specific, authorized endpoints

### 4. Logging Security
- **Structured Logging**: Production logs use JSON format for parsing
- **Sensitive Data Redaction**: Passwords, tokens, and authorization headers are automatically redacted
- **Minimal Request Logging**: Production logs exclude request bodies and query parameters
- **Stack Trace Control**: Full stack traces only in development environment

### 5. Frontend Security
- **Form State Clearing**: Sensitive form data cleared on component unmount
- **Post-submit Cleanup**: Form fields cleared immediately after successful authentication
- **Back Button Protection**: Prevents exposure of sensitive data via browser navigation

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Session secret for token hashing (minimum 32 characters)
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-session-secret-minimum-32-characters-change-this

# JWT secret for token generation (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-jwt-secret-minimum-32-characters-long-change-this-now
```

## Security Best Practices

### Token Management
1. Always hash tokens before database storage
2. Use strong, random secrets (minimum 32 characters)
3. Rotate secrets periodically in production
4. Never log tokens in any environment

### API Response Design
1. Return only required data for each endpoint
2. Create specific endpoints for detailed user information
3. Implement field-level authorization where needed
4. Document what data each endpoint returns

### Logging Strategy
1. Use structured logging in production
2. Redact all sensitive fields automatically
3. Include correlation IDs for request tracking
4. Monitor logs for security events

### Frontend Data Handling
1. Clear form data on unmount and after submission
2. Avoid storing sensitive data in component state longer than necessary
3. Use proper input validation before submission
4. Handle authentication errors gracefully

## Future Security Enhancements

### Recommended for Production
1. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Migrate from localStorage to secure cookies
   - Eliminates XSS token theft risk
   - Requires CSRF protection implementation
   - Needs SameSite=Strict configuration

2. **Refresh Token Flow**: Implement short-lived access tokens
   - Access tokens: 15-30 minutes
   - Refresh tokens: 7-30 days
   - Automatic token rotation

3. **Rate Limiting Enhancement**: Add per-user rate limiting
   - Current: IP-based limiting
   - Future: User-based throttling
   - Failed attempt tracking

4. **Security Headers**: Enhanced CSP and security headers
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-Frame-Options
   - Strict-Transport-Security

5. **Audit Logging**: Track security-relevant events
   - Failed login attempts
   - Password changes
   - Session invalidations
   - Suspicious activities

## Testing Security Features

### Test Token Hashing
```bash
# Create a session and verify token is hashed
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","email":"test@example.com","password":"SecurePass123!","agreeToTerms":true}'

# Check MongoDB - token should be hashed, not plain JWT
```

### Test Protected Logout
```bash
# Try logout without auth (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/auth/logout

# Try logout with valid token (should succeed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/auth/logout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Test Response Minimization
```bash
# Login and verify response contains only essential fields
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"SecurePass123!"}'

# Response should NOT include credits field
```

## Incident Response

### If Database is Compromised
1. Tokens are hashed - cannot be used directly
2. Rotate SESSION_SECRET immediately
3. Invalidate all sessions by clearing sessions collection
4. Force all users to re-authenticate
5. Review audit logs for suspicious activity

### If XSS Vulnerability is Found
1. Current localStorage tokens are vulnerable
2. Invalidate all sessions immediately
3. Deploy XSS fix
4. Consider emergency migration to HttpOnly cookies
5. Notify users to change passwords

### If Secrets are Exposed
1. Rotate JWT_SECRET and SESSION_SECRET immediately
2. Invalidate all existing sessions
3. Update secrets in all environments
4. Force re-authentication for all users
5. Review git history and remove exposed secrets

## Compliance Notes

This implementation follows security best practices including:
- OWASP Authentication Guidelines
- CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
- CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
- CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
- CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information

Regular security audits and penetration testing are recommended.
